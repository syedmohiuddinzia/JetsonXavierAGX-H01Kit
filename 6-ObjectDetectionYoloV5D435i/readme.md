# Object Detection YoloV5 - D435i
YOLOv5 rocket is a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, and represents Ultralytics open-source research into future vision AI methods, incorporating lessons learned and best practices evolved over thousands of hours of research and development.</br>
YoloV5 default model is trained for 79 different classes and we will use it for object detection with jetson Xavier AGX H01 Kit using RealSense D435i.</br>
