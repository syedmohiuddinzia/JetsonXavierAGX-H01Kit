# Intel RealSense D435i on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier

This camera includes a built in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Adding an IMU allows your application to refine its depth awareness in any situation where the camera moves. This opens the door for rudimentary SLAM and tracking applications allowing better point-cloud alignment. It also allows improved environmental awareness for robotics and drones. The use of an IMU makes registration and calibration easier for handheld scanning system use cases and is also important in fields such as virtual/augmented reality and drones. When using the D435i, our Intel RealSense SDK 2.0 provides IMU data that is time stamped to align with our high quality depth data.</br>

## Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
The IMU is used for the detection of movements and rotations in 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF). An IMU combines a variety of sensors with gyroscopes to detect both rotation and movement in 3 axes, as well as pitch, yaw and roll. It is used in applications such as gaming and pointing devices as well as image stabilization.
